For context, at the start of December a friend of mine (we'll call her Char) was talking about a dress she made for a fashion exhibition and mentioned that her first dress was rejected by her boss. She'd showed the rejected dress to my GF and I, it was this gorgeous long sleeved backless evening dress and my GF just said rather offhandedly ""Hey, that would probably fit you AceZero!"".

At this point, Char eyes light up so she asks me if I would try it on which I initially shot down but then I remember one of my NYRs had been ""to be more bold"". I told her I would try it on so long as they were no pictures, Char was disappointed but agreed so I put on this dress and I was...mortified. I have a lot of body image issues so regardless of how much they told me I looked good in it I just felt ugly and like that dress was 'too good' for me.

Fast forward to this Wednesday, my GF and I are picking what were going to wear to a friends NYE party because we needed to come home from work, shower, get dressed and out the door. My GF mentions that dress again and says ""You know, I love you no matter what you wear but you were beautiful in that dress"" I brush it off but it had been niggling at me in the back of my mind.

Thursday afternoon, I bit the bullet after work and dropped by Char's place to ask about the dress telling her I was going to wear it at the NYE party tomorrow. Come NYE, I'm standing in our bedroom in this dress and I can't look at myself in the mirror so I worked on the mantra that if my GF says it's fine then it's fine because I wasn't going to get out the house if I saw myself in it. (I brought a change of clothes just in case)

Get to the party and I felt a little over-dressed but everyone else had dressed up too so I wasn't that out-of-place. The thing is, so long as I didn't see myself in the dress I was fine and everyone at the party commented on how awesome I looked in it. I felt so stupid that the only person who couldn't see that was me and how the hell was I going to get through a whole night without 'seeing' myself. (I was dreading going to the bathroom)

It's at this point, I hear two familiar voices with one saying ""f\*\*king hell!"" and the other saying ""I know right!"". Turn around to see my best friend Blake and Char coming towards me (they'd been out getting the food for the party). I forgot that Blake hadn't seen me in the dress beforehand and as she's always been a 'big sister' to me getting her approval was a big confidence boost.

I decide to tell Blake what the problem is so she asks the host of the party if we can use the master bedroom's en-suite bathroom (confidence is something Blake has never lacked). Once in there, she told me to stand in front of the mirror once I was ready which I did. I just felt sick and I kept turning my back on it because I couldn't look at myself in that dress.

Then I noticed something, every time I turn back around I felt less sick and I started looking over my shoulder to see the backless part of the dress. I then did a full twirl in the dress and I realised that I love wearing this dress, this dress wasn't 'too good' for me instead it was 'just right' for me. Blake always has a way knowing what I need, she said ""All you needed was to get used to it"".

I feel like I ended 2021 on a high note and started 2022 on the right foot when comes to dealing with my body image issues. I'm so glad my GF encouraged me to wear that dress to the party otherwise I would be no further forward when it's comes to loving myself and the skin that I'm in. Also, Blake is a true friend who's never afraid to give me a short, sharp shake when I need it most which is something I will always be grateful for.

(I achieved ALL my NYRs just in time to make some new ones, happy new year!)"

According to the staff on the ward he was 'no bother' so I thought his discharge would be easy too. I don't know if it was the fact that he was basically walking out the door that led him to be more 'frank' with his opinions but this is the exchange that took place:

Me: ""Sir, here's your aftercare medication package which should have everything you need while you recover at home. Do you have any questions, sir""

Bill: ""Nah, I'm fine"" \*pauses\* ""My, you must be very fertile!""

Me: ""uh wait, WHAT!""

Bill: ""With tits like yours, you must be on that pill or you'd be getting knocked up at the drop of a hat!""

(Me and the male nurse escorting Bill share a moment of shocked silence before the male nurse speaks up)

MN: ""Sir, what you just say is wholly unacceptable and won't be tolerated in this hospital!""

Bill: ""What, you think I'm wrong or something!?""

MN: ""Yes, I do. Now, apologise to my colleague!""

(Bill grabs his AMP and starts marching towards the door followed swiftly by the MN)

Bill: \*while marching\* ""That's the problem with this bloody generation, bunch of snowflakes! You reject biology and yet have the nerve to call yourselves doctors and nurses, ridiculous!""

At this point, we could of halted his taxi and had him detained by security for 'verbal abuse of a staff member' but with patients like him it's best to just get rid of them. I told the MN to ""let him go"" as the patient clambered into the back of the taxi, the taxi driver did look over at the MN and the MN give him the nod to go.

I reported the incident to my boss who told me that I did the right thing in that kind of situation and it's best with patients like that to just get them out the door. I also recorded the incident on his file which was counter-signed by the MN as a witness so in future any HCP who has to deal with him is aware of his previous behavior towards NHS staff. Just another day as a woman working in healthcare..."

I take two at the start of my shift and two at the beginning of my break so they'll be kicking in by the end of my break. Someone wasn't happy about this which led to me overhearing this absolute gem of mansplaining:

""*Did you see the lass in the locker room popping painkillers like they're candy because she on her period and  sh\*t! If it's such a problem for her, she should just go on the pill!""*

\*long sigh\*

I hate this mentality that whenever to comes to any issue with us women, especially when it involves our uterus, it is either completely trivialized or it can be 'magically cured' with BC. Firstly, they are a myriad of reasons why women take or don't take BC and it shouldn't be the default position that every woman is on BC. Secondly, assuming that BC would be an easier alternative than me taking painkillers during my period is mind-boggling considering the side-affects of BC compared to OTC painkillers.

Finally, the irony of him saying 'popping painkillers like they're candy' wasn't lost on me as a trainee pharmacist where knowing about dosages and the time intervals between doses is pretty essential in my job role. I reported it to my boss who said she'd investigate, she came back later that same day and told me several other people had also heard this colleague's inappropriate comment as well as seeing who had said it. (I simply overheard it, I didn't see who said it )

Fast forward to yesterday and my boss informed me that the employee in question has been fired as well as being barred from re-joining the NHS at any point in the future. Apparently, he'd made similar inappropriate comments towards female colleagues and been given multiple chances to 'improve' which clearly hasn't happened. I'm just glad that I've got a boss who takes things like this seriously and never brushes it to one side as 'banter' or that I should 'lighten up' and 'learn to take a joke'.

Some colleagues have started calling me 'troublemaker' due to this incident but it's backfired as I see that as a badge of honor. If being a 'troublemaker' is what it takes to stop men making comments about my health and body then so be it! I just had to vent a bit now it's over I can talk about it so thank you!"

I was asked as I have advanced first aid training and I'm good friends with the instructor so I agree and we got everything setup for the first class of the course.

Everyone comes in and we inform them that the first session were going to go through the procedure for treating each kind of injury on a PowerPoint before we move on to practical practice. Everything is going swimmingly until we get to burns and I ask the question: *""Do you put anything on a burn?""*.

This woman at the front hand goes up and I ask her what the answer and she says *""A clean dressing to help the burn to heal but you don't put any kind of cream on it as that can irritate the burn area""*. I am just about to respond when I hear from the back of the class someone scoff and then say *""I thought the smart people were suppose to sit at the front!""* follow by a chorus of laughing from the backrow.

At this point, I notice the backrow has 5 men in it who had no interest in being there whatsoever and are just there because their boss told them that they would be paid for going on the course. I decided to simply respond to the women's answer by saying *""Yes, that is the correct answer""* because it is true.

The backrow's response was priceless, it took them a moment to realise that they were wrong and that they had basically just made fools of themselves in front of the class. The ring leader try to salvage the situation by saying *""She's probably done the course before, that's how she knows the answers*"".

At this point the instructor said this:

*""Yes, this is why it important for the people who are here for the first time to listen and learn""*

The ring leader decides to not make the hole he dug himself any deeper and doesn't say another word of the rest of the PowerPoint. Afterwards, we chatted with some of the students while the people on the backrow decided to make a Irish exit to avoid any further embarrassment. Thought I just share this with you all, thank you."

For context, my friends had recommended a new café that opened up near the hospital I work at so I decided to go to it today during my lunch break. Understandably, it was packed so I got my food to-go and started walking back to work when I hear someone said this: *""Well look at you, what a stunner eh!"".* Now, I assumed that the man in question was saying that to his SO but I was about to find out that he was talking to me.

Next thing I hear is *""Oh, you think you're too good to talk to me! you sooty cow!""* at this point I quickly look over my shoulder to see this guy glaring at me as he shouts *""hey, I'm talking to you!""*. luckily, the crossing stayed on the green man just long enough for me to get across while his path is blocked by the traffic once he got there. I thought this was the end of it but he then decided to walk parallel to me down the street harassing me all the way, I started to panic as I could feel an PTSD attack coming on.

Panicking and just wanting to get away from this guy I decided to take the first alleyway I came to (I know, I know) when something he said sent me over the edge. I can't remember what his exact words were as I was trying my best to block him out but they were words to the affect of I deserved to get attacked and r\*ped in that alleyway to teach me some manners. At this point, I can't remember much because I was having a PTSD attack in this alleyway and none of my coping strategies were working.

I remember ending up on my hands and knees puking my guts up, then someone saying ""oh god!"" and offering me a hand. They helped me into the back room of their store, gave me a glass of water and a basin in case I was going to be sick again while my mind was still reeling. The people who helped me were co-owners of a record store (husband and wife team) and they initially thought I might be newly pregnant due to the terrible morning sickness the manageress had when she was pregnant with their first child. (I'm not BTW)

I told them about what had happened and the manager went outside to see if he could catch him while the manageress looked after me. After sitting for a while, my boss (the pharmacist) rang me up because as far as she knows I've just gone AWOL which is something you can't do at any job BUT especially not at a job where lives are on the line. Thankfully, she was very understanding once she was aware of what had happened and asked me to come back in when I was able to.

I had to go back to the hospital anyway as all my stuff was in my locker and my car was in the car park so the manageress drove me there as I was in no fit state to walk the rest of the way. Once there, the senior pharmacist (my boss's boss) realised that what my boss had said was true and she wasn't just covering for me. She gave me the rest the day off and I gave a statement to the police about the incident, they said they'll hopefully be able to I.D the man through CCTV footage.

My GF has been super supportive and my boss told me to see how I feel in the morning because she doesn't want me rushing back to work after such a severe PTSD attack. I'm just so angry and frustated with myself that I let what that guy said get under my skin but also scared that my attacks can still be so strong after all this time."

For context, I'd just picked up some things from the local supermarket and was heading towards my car when I heard voices coming from the bike rack around the corner from the supermarket exit. saw three 6th former girls (16-18) picking on a 13 year old girl (we'll call her Anna), for a moment I froze and yes I know it's pathetic for a 22 year old woman to be scared of a bunch of teenage girls. (I'll get to that)

At this point, I know I can't be the bystander who walks away and does nothing otherwise I'd be a complete hypocrite (and coward) so I stand between Anna and the three girls and loudly say ""leave her alone!"". The ring leader says ""Who's this bitch, your mom! or maybe she's your big sis!"" and goes on to mock me by saying ""Oh, I terrified"".

Anna then shouts back ""better than your big sis who's a rapist!"" and the ring leader replies ""Oh, you still believe that lying two-faced cow said about my sis! No wonder you're the laughing stock of the school!"". I had to get a handle on this situation so I then declared ""if you don't leave now, I'll call the police!"" the two girls behind the ring leader start to get a bit jumpy.

She must of known I wasn't bluffing because the ring leader decided to back off but not before saying ""What-the-fuck-ever! Let's leave these two lesbos to it, I don't want to catch AIDS or some shit!"". They moved off and I took Anna back to my car so I could see to her wounds, find out that the ring leader's family are big donors to the school she goes to so the school just sweep everything under the carpet.

This included the allegations a few years ago of the ring leader's older sister raping a 14 year old girl, the whole thing was quashed as ""a schoolgirl rumour that got out of hand"" and any papers that did report on it had to print a retraction and remove the article from their online archive. As someone who was gang-raped when I was 13 at the all-girl's catholic school I when to this made my blood run cold.

I was basically shamed into silence because the girls who did it had family members that were high-ranking in both the school I attended and the catholic community my family was a part of. She told me she's tried to get her parents to transfer her but none of the other girls schools in the area are to the same 'standard' and she terrified they may send her to a boarding school if she pushes too much.

I gave her a lift to the street near her house, she didn't want her parents to see her getting out of a stranger's car (which is understandable). I made sure she got through her front door before I pulled away but I was so frustated that they wasn't more I could of done for her. I would hope that the school protecting an alleged rapist would be enough to get your daughter transferred ASAP!

I'm still coming to terms with what happened to me at my school nearly 10 years ago but I more angry that parents are still putting their children at risk for the 'prestige' of them going to 'good all-girls catholic school'. I'll stop here before I start rambling, just needed to vent so thank you to anyone who reads this."

The lab manager takes me through how to enter and exit the lab as well as what PPE to wear, he then shows me to a work station and leaves me to do my work.

I start to do my work when a technician comes into the lab from the loading bay and says rather rudely ""Can YOU come through and help with this MEDEX delivery that needs to be loaded and sent off!"". He then storms off, I catch the attention of a passing science assistant and ask him if he can help with the MEDEX delivery. He says ""sure"" and heads off so I get on with my work, I finally have all the samples prepped so I place them in the machine for the robot to do a run.

While I'm babysitting the machine, the technician comes back in and says in the same rude tone ""You can't just stand around all day doing nothing, there's plenty to be getting on with you know!"". Before I have a chance to reply an HSA (healthcare Science Associate) bluntly says to him ""Do you know who she is"" to which he replies ""She's the new science assistant"".

The associate laughs and says ""She's a trainee pharmacist so she's MY boss"" this technician face when white as a sheet when he realised he'd just been incredibly rude (twice) to his boss's boss. The associate then goes on to say ""Even if she was an assistant, you don't talk to any colleague like that. Your appraisal is coming up and I'm very disappointed in the behaviour I just saw!"".

Got told the other day that he got put on employment probation and move to auxiliary duties until further notice due to a 'unsatisfactory appraisal review'. I'm still amazed at the amount of men that see a woman in a job and assume she must be the lowest rung on the ladder, especially considering how many high ranking members of staff at both the hospital and university are women.

**Birds of a feather flock together** \- The basis of a good relationship is finding common ground and what brings you together as a couple, it's put the emphasis on your differences so you can decide whether those are deal-breakers for you. My auntie said that the old ""opposites attract"" mentality is how a lot of people get stuck in relationships where there's nothing wrong but they are totally incompatible because they have nothing in common to bond over.

**A true relationship blossoms naturally over time** \- following time limits on how long until you get to certain mile stones is the first nail in the coffin for any relationship, some things might happen quickly while other things might take more time. Also, DON'T start obsessing over when other couples reach certain mile stones because every relationship is different and what works for one couple isn't going to work for every couple.

**NO ULTIMATUMS** \- The moment you are giving (or been given) a ultimatum then stick a fork in that relationship because it is done! That's no longer a consensual relationship, that is now a coercive relationship and the best thing to do is break up and move on because nothing good will come of that relationship.

**A person that cares about those around them will care about you, a person that neglects those around them will neglect you** \- Pretty self-explanatory, as a teenager I used to crush on ""cool, aloof women"" like crazy until I realise that a relationship with them is going to be distant, cold and pretty pointless in the long term. Also, be careful if they are very rude or aggressive towards member of  staff at stores and restaurants because that's a big indicator of an abuser.

**A drunk person's actions are a sober person's thoughts** \- NEVER let your partner blame what they did on alcohol because the alcohol didn't make them violent or abusive, all the alcohol did was let the mask slip and they showed their true colours as an abuser (or worse).

I obviously learnt a lot about relationships by being in a relationship (experience is always the best teacher) but these pieces of advice really help point me in the right direction so I will always be glad and grateful to my auntie for that. By all means add your own in the comments, thanks for reading!"

No response, I try not to single out patients but I politely say to him ""Do you need that prescription filled out, sir?"".

""No, I'm alright petal!"" so I walk away from the window and ask our trainee pharmacy assistant 'Jay' to keep an eye on the hand-in window which is code for 'We got one of THOSE patients' (Note: 'Jay' is the only man on my pharmacy team). The moment 'Jay' appears at the hand-in window, the man hops up and comes straight over to hand in his prescription because apparently I'm just chopped liver! The man then starts asking 'Jay' all sorts of questions about his prescription and the medication on it.

Being a trainee pharmacy assistant 'Jay' doesn't know the answer to any of these questions (which is understandable) so says to the man ""I'm sorry sir, I don't know. I'll get the pharmacist for you"". I go back over to the window to answer this man's questions about his prescription, his first question is ""Is they anyone else I can talk to about this?"". I use this opportunity to say ""I'm capable of answering any queries you may have. If you wish for a second opinion I can get my boss to speak with you"".

He's interested UNTIL he hears HER name and realises that he's going to have to speak to a woman one way or the other. He decides to ask me BUT rather than asking clear and concise questions like he was asking 'Jay' he decides he needs to 'mansplain' his condition and medication to me.

We FINALLY get to the questions which almost always have simple 'yes or no' answers to them, get his prescription filled out and send him on his way. I thought it might be an embarrassment thing like they'd been prescribed something for a 'male issue' (like erectile dysfunction) but none of the men who have does this were prescribed anything like that.

We've even experimented like sending over a different team member but they won't come over until 'Jay' is at the hand-in window because 'women don't know anything about healthcare or medicine"". /s"

I then hear a man call after me ""hey, miss?"" and my first thought is ""Why can't I be left alone"", I decide to continue to walk only to hear the same man say ""excuse me, miss?"". I start thinking ""If you try to get my attention one more time...!"" followed by the same man saying ""ma'am?"" in a far more meeker tone of voice.

I turn around to see a teenager, no older than 14, holding my money clip and as soon as our eyes meet he's says ""I'm sorry ma'am, you dropped this"". It must of dropped out of my bag when I fished my keys out and I didn't hear it hit the floor due to the background noise, it would be a blow to my pocket if I had lost it. So I say ""thank you very much"" but I couldn't hide the anger in my voice, the way the teenager withdrew his hand and recoiled in fear made me feel like sh\*t!

He quickly says ""no problem!"" and caught up with his friends who were waiting for him heading in the opposite direction to me. So, there am I in the middle of a shopping mall looking (and feeling) like the biggest, most ungrateful b\*tch who ever walked the earth because of the way I treat a kid trying to do the right thing. He could of pocketed it and I would of been none the wiser until later on by which point he and his friends would of been long gone.

I'm angry that I'm so used to men calling after me to make crass remarks about my body or what they would do to me sexually that this is what they've reduced me to. My GF saw a silver lining that it's nice to hear about a young man who's been brought up right which is true but I still feel like shit for the way that I treat him."

A man saw my 'Feminist and proud' bag so decided to tell me that ""Feminism actually hurts the fight for women's rights"". I responded by saying that ""I believe Feminism is actually a great help in the fight for women's rights but we'll agree to disagree"". As I walked away he told me that I'm a 'nasty, ungrateful b\*tch' who should be 'thankful' to my father for my existence.

No mention of my mother who both grew and gave birth to me but considering that my father was an abusive monster of a man the only thing I'm thankful for when it comes to my father is that he's dead so can't hurt or abuse anyone else.

At lunch, we when to the bookstore's café (the reading room) for lunch and a guy who had spent the last 20 minutes 'hovering' around where we were browsing tried to pull a chair up to our table. Luckily, the manageress was passing and told the man that only 4 people max. can sit at a table because of COVID. (They was a empty table right next to ours BTW)

This guy proceeds to throw a hissy fit which ended with him knocking over a (empty) book cart and shouting that he's ""never coming back to this POS bookstore if that's the way they treat customers!"".

At the next bookstore we when to a man pointed at my mask which had the lesbian flag on it and declared that ""You shouldn't encourage them you know! They're robbing men of their future wives!"". My GF then cuddled my arm and said ""I don't see how that's me or my fiancée problem!"" the look of horror and disgust on his face was priceless and seeing him storm off in the huff was pretty funny too.

Finally, they were several women who gave my GF and I the ""what a waste!"" treatment or some variation on that homophobic term. I actually heard two new ones today, one was ""They would of been such beautiful brides"" and the other was ""They would of made such wonderful mothers"" because gay women can't get married or have children apparently.

All in all, a mixed day BUT we got a good haul and we had some great chats with fellow bookworms so it wasn't all bad. All the bookstores we visited had a sale on wlw literature in honour of lesbian visibility week which was nice and I finally bought the whole set of 'My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness' because I've heard nothing but good things about it. Just needed to vent a little so TYSM!"

Then, I had a horrible thought as I felt something wet on my pajamas and brought my hand up to see...blood. Despite the pain, I quickly got out of bed and... it was a complete disaster zone! I began to panic because when this happened at home I'd get a beating from my father as well as having to wash the sheets by hand as a punishment.

Just as a mixture of panic and pain was about to overwhelm me, my GF came out the en-suite and had just enough time to say ""you're up early"" before she realised what she'd just walk into. I just froze, my GF came over and put her hand on my arm ""It's okay, I'm going to fix this. It's not your fault"". Getting the reassurance I never got at home was so comforting but I still had to rush into the en-suite so I could be violently sick into the toilet while my GF rubbed my back.

At this point, I wanted to see how bad things were so I took off my pajamas and sat naked on the toilet to see what the damage was. It was a 'flare-up' from a faulty gene that I have which can cause severe periods among other gynecological problems but I have no idea what caused this one as I haven't had a period this severe since I was a teenager (my last 'flare-up' was back in 2019 when I was 19). There was a knock on the bathroom door, I was hoping it was the grim reaper to see me off this mortal coil.

It was just my GF telling me not to worry about the sheets or my pajamas because she's put them all in the washing machine after treating them with stain remover. I asked what about the mattress and duvet, she said nothing got on the mattress but some got on the duvet which made me squirm because I was so ashamed. My GF placed her hand on my shoulder and said ""It's only blood, I had 3 younger sisters so me and my mum had to handle this on multiple occasions. No shame in it"".

She helped me get ready as I desperately needed a shower but I was still a little unsteady on my feet so she stayed in the bathroom in case I fell or I felt like I was going to. Once I was dressed and settled in the living room she got herself sorted, I still felt embarrassed about the mess I'd made and the fact that my GF was having to watch over me like this. I felt rough for the rest of the day but I wasn't going to miss my good friend's baby shower and after some painkillers I was able to power through it.

I just needed to vent because ever since I found out about this faulty gene the doctors have done what they always do once they found out that BC doesn't work. That is to say ""sucks to be you"" and when I mentioned an elective Hysterectomy they always say ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it"". I feel like they're going to wait until I get cancer before taking this seriously and yes this faulty gene puts me at a much higher risk of developing gynecological cancers in my 20's and 30's.

On the upside, my GF is my rock and I don't know what I'd do without her. I am the luckiest woman in the world to have such an amazing partner! :)"

It was done in collaboration with the 'Street Angels/Student Angels' (and the student union) and the route when from the main city park to the university campus. (I won't say which city for privacy reasons, please don't ask me)

Meeting up at the park and seeing everyone's placards was exciting, my personal favourites were 'over-educated and proud' and 'Women die everyday in childbirth, how the hell is that Pro-Life?'. On our demonstration most people just watched, we got cheered (and jeered), we walked past a church just as the congregation were coming out and they all gave us the death glares as we marched past.

It was when we could see the university that we ran into and ended up in a 'stand-off' with a counter-protest which we had been warned of beforehand. The most disgusting part of the anti-choice protest was a group who had signs around their necks that said things like 'liberated woman' or 'feminist' and a baby doll, they had then covered themselves, their signs and their baby dolls in fake blood.

Thankfully, the police who had been escorting us moved the counter-protest on as it was a 'wildcat' protest while ours had been approved by the local city council. Once we got to the university and had lunch we heard about women's experiences getting access to abortions in the UK before the ban was lifted in 1967.

In most cases, someone from the WAC would read out their story or statement but some women wanted to read them out themselves. Seeing a woman in her 70's break down when telling us about the back-alley abortion she had back in the 60's when she was a underage teenager was absolutely heart-breaking. Her parents found out and disowned her for being a 'filthy sinner' and as someone who's parents did the same due to my sexuality, I knew how much that hurts.

The other thing that they brought up and I didn't realised was just because the ban was lifted in 1967 didn't mean that your local hospital had to provide that service. A lot of women had to go up north where access to abortions was more widely available (just like the US). Newcastle upon Tyne became well-known for offering abortions to women from anywhere in the UK, when other NHS trusts told them to stop Newcastle basically said 'Not until you start offering them to women yourself'.

We aren't going to let the bastards grind us down, if they want to wage a war on women's rights and freedoms then we are going to fight them tooth and nail EVERY. INCH. OF. FUCKING. WAY! Regardless if it's the US, UK, Ukraine or anywhere else in the world, we'll keep fighting until we win. I heard a great quote today which was:

""EVERY fight is OUR fight, we don't get to 'sit one out' because what happens over THERE (US) matters over HERE (UK/ROTW)""

I wanted to give some advice on this topic because just like buying anything that's geared towards men, there's some things you need to keep in mind so you can cut through the BS and get what you want.

**You want a practical gun, not a 'pretty' gun** \- Gun store clerks will try to steer you in the direction of the 'pretty' guns or a gun that's the 'ladies edition' and it's extremely irritating and patronizing! In most cases it because they can't sell them so they try to pawn them off on you, they usually cost more and have no benefit over the ordinary model (even firearms aren't immune to the dreaded 'pink tax').

**Get the caliber that you can handle** \- This is especially important if you need to fire follow-up shots, no point having a gun that so powerful that the recoil makes getting off another shot difficult which will impede your accuracy. 9mm is a good all-rounder, good balance of weight, recoil and stopping power as well as being widely available but try a few different calibers and see which one suits you.

**Get trained so you can be safe and get the most out of your gun** \- Pretty obvious, gun safety and being able to properly use and utilize your gun in a situation where you are fearing for your safety (or your life) is of the upmost importance. A number of gun training courses do women-only classes for women who want to learn how to use their gun and practice their shooting in a women-only space.

**If you can afford it, get a handgun and a shotgun** \- I would say those two are most practical and versatile, handgun for everyday carry and a shotgun for home defence. Again, ensure you get your shotgun in the right 'gauge', I would say a 20 gauge is a good all-rounder but if you can handle a 16 gauge or 12 gauge then go for it! Also, ensure you can work the action on the shotgun, most modern pump-actions are fairly easy to cycle but always double-check that you can operate your firearm.

**See if you find a gun store with a member of staff who's a woman** \- They will listen to you if have an unique situation at home, for example one woman wanted a handgun for her nightstand but she shared her bedroom with her toddler daughter. The clerk showed her a handgun that wouldn't fire if the magazine was removed so she could keep it on her nightstand unloaded and when she needed to investigate a disturbance she could put the magazine into the gun and it would be ready to use.

**Finally, buying a gun (or two) DOESN'T make you a 'bad' person** \- You can still vote democrat, you can still care about gun crime and gun violence because at the end of the day a gun is a tool. The tool is morally neutral, it's the person who wields it that decides whether they are going to use that tool for good or evil. As far as I'm concerned, if you're buying a gun to defend yourself and your family that sounds like quite a morally good thing to do IMO.

Also, look into getting a conceal carry permit as having the ability to carry a concealed gun gives you an advantage over a would-be attacker. There are actually 'subcompact' guns that are built with CC in mind, just something to think about and in some states you don't need a permit so you could CC from day 1 if you wanted to.

EDIT: If you want to try and insult me by calling me a 'gun nut' or a 'gun bunny' then by all means continue, I just wanted to give some general advice as a woman to other women in a safe space for women. Most advice on firearms comes from 'manly men' who completely glaze over the fact that some women may not have the strength to handle the recoil of a .45 ACP or a 12 gauge shotgun shell."

Luckily, I saw him walking out the door while I was using the self-checkout and decided that the 'hovering' was just my mind running away with itself (or so I thought). I'd just started walking to my car when I heard someone say ""Hey sweetheart, need a ride?"" I look to where the voice came from and it's the elderly man standing next to a sports car.

It took me a second for my brain to realise that he was talking to me, I quickly thought of what to say so I asked ""how old are you?"" and he responds in a very cocky tone of voice ""66 but you wouldn't know it"" (trust me, it showed). I followed up with ""So, you're three times my age and you don't think this is... inappropriate?"" he looked at me completely befluttered that his sports car and ""good looks"" hadn't won me over yet.

At this point, I decided to be direct and say ""No, I'm not going to get into a stranger's car to go god knows where and do god knows what!"". I started walking back toward the store because I didn't want him to see what my car looked like, he screams after me ""FINE, WHO WOULD WANT TO GO OUT WITH A SLUTTY POST-WALL B\*TCH LIKE YOU ANYWAY!"". He jumps into his car and starts to leave the car park very aggressively, I stood behind the pedestrian bollards in case he tried to run me over.

Once I was sure he had left, I made a beeline for my car, got in and locked the doors with my heart still beating out of my chest. Why can't I just go to the supermarket in peace and why on earth does a man who's old enough to my grandad think he's so irresistible that I'm going to throw myself at him just because he's got a flashy car (Cuddles and kisses from my GF helped me calm down once I got home).

We hadn't been to that restaurant since then so we thought it would be the perfect place to celebrate such a milestone, I decided to go all-out by booking a table in the formal dining hall (It was my treat after all to celebrate her success).

Long story short, we had a fantastic evening until towards the end we could hear laughter coming from the main dining hall, my GF even joked ""I wonder who's on stage"". As we were being led out of the dining hall by our server we passed by the George Carlin wannabe with a woman who looked so embarrassed to be sitting with him (I felt so bad for her).

Once we got into my car I turned to my GF and said ""Did you see that woman sitting with that guy, do you think I should of said something?"". She shared my concern but it was probably just a bad first date and me grandstanding in the middle of the restaurant would of only made things worse as the guy might of gotten violent.

I started to leave the car park but I just couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong, it was at the exit of the car park when I saw that woman from before. She looked scared and like she was fanatically making phone calls but no-one was picking up. At this point, she noticed us so we asked ""is everything alright?"" she tried to play it off that she just needed some air but we could hear the fear in her voice (I know that tremble all too well).

She could tell we weren't buying it so she came closer to the car and said in a hushed whisper *""I just want to go home!""* so we offered her a lift, she couldn't get in the back seat quick enough! For a minute or two, I just drove as I didn't want to pry and I wanted to give her time to calm down as something had definitely upset her.

Come to find out that she matched with this guy on some app and while he seems alright some of his messages seemed a bit 'off'. It didn't long for messages that were a bit 'off' to turn into full-blown gaslighting and mansplaining once they started talking at the restaurant. He was making tasteless jokes and teasing her about how shy she was being. (She was trying to hide her embarrassment)

Her cousin (who she lives with) told her not to go due to the messages but she decided to go anyway because...her mum and sister keep pestering her about finding a man to marry. They said that if she doesn't find someone soon she'll lose her youthfulness and be unable to attract a suitable husband, She's fricking 22 BTW! (The same age as I am)

Curiosity got the better of me so I asked what her family and friends think, her dad wants her to be happy and if her career makes her happy then that's all that matters. Her cousin said she should focus on her career and forget about all that dating rubbish because at their age ""men are nothing but trouble"". (a woman after my own heart)

Once we got to her house she asked us what she should do about her date, I suggested that she could either ghosted him or message him saying she could tell it wasn't going to work and then block him. She went with option 2, we told her that we agree with her dad and her cousin that she should focus on what brings her joy in life. (My GF and I are both career-focused women who love our jobs)

I know it's been said here so many times but always trust you gut, she told us before she got out the car that her gut had told her to block the guy and move on after the second 'dodgy' message but she persisted. We made sure that she got through her front door okay before pulling away and I'm just glad we were able to help her get out of a bad situation, never put politeness ahead of your safety."

However, while most people have been congratulating her they have been some people (mostly men) who believe that now she's earning good money I should give up my job as a trainee Pharmacist for someone who really needs  that job to take care of their family. (Because all women secretly want to be housewives)/s

I hate this mentality that I'm somehow 'robbing' a hypothetical individual of this job and that the life goals that I'm trying to achieve (regardless of my relationship status) don't matter. Firstly, I've worked DAMN hard to get where I am today and it'll be snowing in HELL before I give this up for anyone. I've seen the dark side of financial dependency with my parents relationship and I swore I'd never willingly put myself in that situation.

On the flip side, why should my GF's success have a negative impact on my life? It just encourages me to pursue my own happiness and success even more after seeing how happy and successful she is. Finally, I'd bet my bottom dollar that they wouldn't be saying or insinuating any of this if I was a MAN who's partner had just become a Dr. In fact, they'd probably be telling him to get a better job or dump her for 'emasculating' him by getting a better job than him.

At the end of the day, my GF is the most important person in my life but my education and career are important to me too. They AREN'T disposable or something I'm going to cast aside now that I've got a successful partner. I'm not going to give up a job that I love just because some dumbass men think that I would be so much 'happier' (and useful) as a housewife then as a Pharmacist."

I felt so bad for this theatre technician as she walked out the theatre covered in bodily fluids, her thousand yard stare said it all and it's the reason why I'm grateful that I work primarily in pre-op and recovery.

So, we get her into decontamination to check what the damage is and thankfully as she was in full theatre PPE none of the bodily fluids touch her body directly meaning the possibility of infection was minimal. I got all the 'dirty' PPE off of her and put it all in the infectious waste bin, including her surgical scrubs just to be safe as I got clean surgical scrubs from the ladies changing room.

I then just sat with her trying to calm her down, telling that she didn't do anything wrong and the surgeon is one of the best and she'll sort out whatever when wrong (She did BTW, the patient made it). Just as everything is settling back down, a orderly comes in to discard of some dirty PPE and decides to FUCKING ASK OUT THE THEATRE TECHNICIAN WHO JUST BE COVERED IN BODILY FLUIDS!

I told him to ""GET OUT NOW!"" because I knew if I reprimanded him I wouldn't be able to stop, I was so angry but I had to maintain my professionalism and composure.

Afterwards, the surgeon decided to let the technician go home early as it was the last surgery of the day in her theatre and I when to the ODO supervisor to report the orderly's inappropriate behaviour. The supervisor must of done something immediately as I didn't see that orderly at all when it came to returning patients to their wards after myself and the recovery nurses had cleared them post-op.

I will never understand what made him think that was appropriate as you aren't allowed to 'ask people out' on the department floor, what the hell made him think it was okay to do it in the 'dirty' PPE room to someone who is recovering from a 'contamination incident' and looks like they're been traumatised!"

Here are some of the 'interesting' interactions I had with them before they when to theatre:

Firstly, one man started to panic when he realised that I would be the one prepping the anesthetic as I couldn't possibly know what I'm doing./s The surgeon talked him round but we made him reaffirm his consent as I'm not going to get sued by some brain-dead misogynist after talking to some ambulance chaser.

Another one try to 'shock jockey' me by telling me he 'shot one last load as it won't happen again' so I bluntly explained to him that having a vasectomy doesn't affect his ability to orgasm or ejaculate, all it does is remove the sperm. After realising he wasn't going to get a reaction out of me he just said 'Oh, I see' rather meekly and then fell silent. (I work in healthcare, I've heard and seen it all before)

Then there was one who said he'd try his best not to get a 'hard-on' but he didn't realise that such a 'hot chick' would be doing the procedure. His face fell when he was introduced to the surgeon and his all-male theatre team which was ironically put together so none of the men felt uncomfortable during the procedure.

Finally, there was the absolute creep who said ""I wouldn't be getting this done if I had a GF as young and as beautiful as you"". This is bad enough but what makes it worse is the fact that 10 mins before this he'd be kissing and cuddling his GF outside the operating department only to come out with a line like that once he's in the pre-op area. (I felt so bad for his GF)

I was glad to see the back of them when the orderlies took them to the day unit, as the saying goes:

""I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed""."

My boss (the surgical pharmacist) has already got a new job and started said job on Monday, I was told that I would go back to my original post as a trainee pharmacist at the outpatient pharmacy.

Now, all the male bosses I spoke to had the same 'that's the way the cookie crumbles' mind-set and this led me to believe that they couldn't do anything because these developments came from the higher-ups. (The higher-ups NEVER change their minds)

On Wednesday, I was asked to attend a meeting about these recent developments and I expected it to be a lot of platitudes but no actual substance. The three people holding the meeting were the matron, the PODP and the senior sister (all women, hence the title) who told me that they were all very annoyed that the 'powers-that-be' had just dropped this on us with no warning but they had a idea.

They had spoken to my former boss (the pharmacist who runs the outpatient pharmacy) and told her that I had far more potential working in the operating department than in the pharmacy. She agreed and suggested that I would be an ideal candidate to be become a operating department practitioner. So, their idea was to transfer me to the OD as a permanent employee (I'm currently on a secondment) and move me from a degree in Pharmacology to a degree in operating department practice.

Nothing else would change and all the units I'd done so far in my current degree were 'core' units that everyone who's studying medicine/life sciences has to do anyway so they would just transfer over so all the work I'd done since January wasn't a waste. They told me that I didn't have to decide on the spot but they would need a answer by Friday. I discussed it with my GF that night (she's a MD who works in the same hospital) and she obviously told me to go for it so I told them the next day I would accept their offer.

So, come Monday August 1st I will be a trainee operating department practitioner (TODP) but this whole ordeal has proven the importance of female bosses. All the (male) bosses attitude was a classic case of 'sucks to be you' while these women worked with my former boss to come up with a practical solution that helped all parties (both progressing my career and benefiting the OD). I just thought I'd post this positive work story about women helping other women out, TYSM for reading!"

The reason this makes me nervous is this sounds like that may be setting up a situation similar to what happened in the US regarding Roe V. Wade.

That is 'because abortion rights are not mentioned IN the UK bill of rights then abortion rights are not protected BY the UK bill of rights' and considering that abortion is technically still a crime in the UK under OAPA the fact that the government deliberately omitted this from the bill of rights seems like a setup to me.

(As a side note, women are STILL charged under this act to this day if it's believed that they obtained a abortion outside of the parameters laid out in The 1967 Abortion Act so the threat is real)

They were also a number of MPs (all white male Tories obviously) posting about how the overturning of RvW as a good thing and these very MPs may well become ministers in September when the new PM is elected. Put all this together and Dominic Raab's comment about abortion rights in the UK being a 'settled' issue doesn't nothing to ease the feeling that the UK may suffer the same fate as the US has.

I don't really know where I was going with this rant other than to bring people's attention to it, I was going to vent about the misogynistic pig that suggested that women should have to pay for the right to our own bodily autonomy in the form of a 'childless tax' but I thought this was far more important.

Stay safe and stay strong, if you live in the UK please contact your MP regardless of their party and tell them to pressure the government into adding abortion rights to the UK bill of rights as well as voting against the bill if it doesn't protect abortion rights."

However, my GF has been getting a lot of comments about my age whenever my GF tells people why I'm off work and it's starting to get on our nerves. (My GF works in the same hospital that did my op)

The reason being is I had this surgery for health reasons as I have stage 4 endometriosis and a faulty BRCA gene which makes the chances of developing ovarian cancer far more likely. Having my tubes removed will hopefully stop the pain caused by endo and reduce the risk of getting cancer as the pre-cancerous cells usually start in the fallopian tubes and then move to the ovaries. (I'm not a oncologist)

The fact that I'm also 'sterilized' is a bonus as I've suffered a life-threatening miscarriage in the past and as a result I have severe tokophobia. I'm so sick and tired of a young woman's worth being tied to her 'fertility' and her ability to bear children because that's apparently more important than our health and wellbeing. It's also disturbing that in the healthcare sector where 'patient choice is paramount' a lot of women are robbed of that choice because they are 'too young' and 'haven't had children yet'.

Yes, I understand that to some people it might be a hard decision but as this surgery has hopefully fixed my endo as well as greatly reducing my risk of developing cancer then it was a no-brainer for me. I just wish people would ask ""why?"" before jumping to conclusions because I've had people blame my C-PTSD for making 'reckless' decisions and telling my GF that she should of 'talk me out of it'.

I just needed to vent for a minute because the last fortnight has been a bit rough (obviously) and these stupid comments were really starting to bug me so thank you so much to anyone who took the time to read this!"

Our first date was so awkward due to the fact that I'd never dated anyone in my entire life (I was 21) and I felt so ugly in my maxi dress while she turns up looking like the 'bell of the ball' in her LBD.

Every time she'd ask me something I'd give some rambling answer then trail off and 'drown' myself in my drink to the point where said ""Not much of a talker, eh!"". It didn't help that when she talked about herself she had the perfect 'chocolate box' lid childhood and was a Jr. Dr. in her final year before she qualified as a fully licensed MD while I have a childhood from hell and was currently a pharmacy tech. with no ambition in life.

After I gave her a lift home and she texted me to make sure I got home alright I cried myself to sleep that night knowing that I'd fucked up, why would a woman that brilliant and beautiful want to date a horrible hag like me! Next day, she texts me saying that a new coffee house was opening up and that we should meet up there for our second date... SECOND DATE! I never texted anyone back so quickly in my life.

Fast forward to December and we moved in together, the owner of the place I was house-sitting for was coming back to live there and my GF's lease was up on her studio apartment so it made sense. I knew I'd broken one of the golden rules but I was willing to risk it for her and it turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life although I understand why most people follow the golden rule as it could of gone horribly wrong.

(TW: Grooming, gang rape. Skip this segment if that's triggering to you, I put the word ***SKIP*** at the end)

I knew at some point I was going to have to tell her so one night I told her about the travelling pastor who groomed and impregnated me when he was 24 and I was 12. I told her about how I broke down and told some of the older girls at my school about what had happened, thinking they would help me. I told her how they tied me up, gagged and gang-raped me leaving me in a pool of my own blood from a miscarriage that led to my uterus hemorrhaging.

The part I remember the most clearly was waking up in the PICU of a hospital bearly clinging onto life after emergency surgery, everything was hurting and in that moment I just wanted to die. Afterwards, I expected her to be disgusted or ashamed of me but all she did was hug me as I broke down in tears.

She told me all the usual stuff about it not being my fault and how strong and brave I was which I'd heard before but from her it felt different, it felt like a massive knot in my stomach had been undone knowing that she still loved me despite was a mess I am due to my childhood of abuse.

***SKIP***

Since then, we just gone from strength to strength as she became a fully qualified MD and I started a Master's degree apprenticeship to become an Advanced Clinical Practitioner. My GF also encouraged me to see a colleague of hers to get my endo treated which led to me having Endometrial ablation followed by a bislap, all the pain is gone now I feel like I've gotten my life back after all these years.

None of this would of happened without the amazing woman I get to call my partner, to celebrate we when back to the same restaurant we had our first date in but this time I remembered my mistake and when with a blouse/skirt combo which was a much better choice than the maxi dress. I just wanted to share a feel-good relationship story so thank you very much for anyone who reads this! :)"

He has asked me for advice (since I'm a gay woman with a GF) and I always told him to work on himself and his career because that drive and ambition will attract women to him, both platonic and romantic. He completely disregarded my advice and continue to plod along without being able to see that nothing is going to happen unless he's proactive and is willing to change.

However, back in the spring he met a woman at a e-tournament and got into a relationship with her as she goes to uni in the city we live in. Fast forward to this week, he asks for my advice (again) but this time around it's with regard to his relationship with his GF who he's been with for 6 months now. He told me that since getting with her he's been motivated to take care of himself, eat better, go to the gym and has gone back to uni part time to further his career. (he just got a big promotion at work too)

His problem is he doesn't know how to fit all this around his GF because he feels like he has no time for her and doesn't know what to do. I gave him some pointers and sent him on his way but I wanted to scream at him ""YOU KNOW WHEN I SAID 'WORK ON YOURSELF' THIS IS WHAT I FUCKING MEANT!"". If he'd motivated himself to do all of these things when he was single like I told him to then he would of realised there's more to life than relationships and that your partner is a person, NOT a 'prize'.

It's infuriating that he may well end up breaking this woman's heart because he spent too much time thinking with his penis and not enough time thinking with his brain! I just had to rant about this as it's depressedly common among young men who's only motivation in life is to 'get a GF'."

The Pharmacist (my boss) told me at Easter that she was selling up and retiring at the end of the year, she said she was happy to keep me on after my apprenticeship ends but the new owner might not keep me on going into 2022.

However, she informed that the big Pharmacy firm she used to work for before she set up her own local Pharmacy occasionally take on apprentices to do BSc or even MSc degrees with them. She said she'd found out if they still do this program and give me a personal letter of recommendation to the contact she still has at the company.

Long story short, She got me a pre-approval interview with the company in question and helped me prep for the interview. Between getting the interview and the interview taking place my sense of optimism turn into existential dread as a million ""what if..."" scenarios flooded my head. So, the day of the interview arrives and I am...terrified!

I'd never had to do an interview for my previous apprenticeship and due to said apprenticeship I'd never had to do a job or university enrollment interview in my life. It didn't help that the building this company was set up in looked like a supervillian lair if it was designed by Google. The interview was socially distanced so it could be conducted without masks, we had a sheet of Perspex between us.

Once the interview started, all my fear seems to melt away and all the prep work my boss did paid off as the interviewer asked me the questions in the exact order my boss told me she would. The interviewer told me that my boss was highly respected in the company so anyone she recommends must be 'top tier'.

That did nothing to settle my nerves but I'd persevered, she was impressed by how much I knew even through I only been studying Pharmacology professionally for two years. Now, we get to the part with me getting too relaxed and making a stupid joke rather than just listening to the interviewer, giving my answer to the question she asked so the interview could end.

So, at the tail-end of the interview she mentioned about medical ethics and the current problem with people spreading misinformation about vaccines (especially the COVID-19 vaccine). She assumed I have no issue with vaccines to which I respond ""I have no issue, the way some people talk about the vaccine you think it had been developed by Weyland-Yutani or something!"".

At this point, the little voice in my head started screaming ""SHUT UP, JUST SHUT UP! NOW YOU'RE SCREWED IT ALL UP!"". The interviewer smiled and said ""very true"" and then took me through the process of leaving the building due to security and COVID protocols. I then spent the next week beating myself up about it, my auntie told me it wouldn't affect anything but I knew I'd messed up.

My boss did help settle me a little by saying that the interviewer (who would be become my boss if I was successful) has a good sense of humour so I had nothing to worry about. Fast forward to Monday (19th July) and I get a phone-call telling me that I'd been accepted onto their BSc apprenticeship program. (The formal acceptance letter arrived Friday 23rd July)

I'll need to attend an employment and enrollment meeting on July 31st so I can start on August 31st and as a bonus I found out from my future boss that she is the head of an all-women team. I'm still nervous as I've only ever worked in a small local Pharmacy and I heard plenty of stories on here about women in male-dominated STEM fields but I'm also super excited to take the next step in my career.

My future boss did mention the joke, she put a J in brackets next to my name to remind her and she did say that she can see why I choose in a career in Pharmacology rather than in stand-up comedy.(I will happily take the L on that one as I'm just so glad it didn't ruin my chances)"

That article is 10 years old so I thought I would do my own and I WON'T be adding a disclaimer because if you aren't a creep then this post has nothing to do with you.

**""Tall girls aren't attractive/You're all skin and bones, real women are thick and curvy""**  
I get comments like this all the time because apparently it's of the upmost importance that I know that they find tall, skinny girls ugly. Yes, because highlighting something I have little to no say in is going to make me magically change my appearance to suit your 'tastes'. If you think I'm so hideous why talk to me at all, leaving me alone would be the best way to show your disgust at my physical appearance.

**""You're too cute to be gay!""**  
On the flip-side, we've got the creeps who aren't repulsed by my height or weight and think that I'm so pretty that I must be straight because all gay women are ugly apparently. Unfortunately, reality is not going to shift because you can't find a date and even if I was as straight as an arrow you wouldn't be in running due to the 'creeper' vibes and the 15 year age gap. (I knew he was 36 and he knew I was 21)

**""You got the butt of a goddess, my ex had one from all the sex we had!""**  
The fact that literally the first thing you did was compliment my bottom and then inform me about you and your ex's sex life has definitely put you directly in the 'creep' pile in my mind. Also, I've known you all of 15 seconds and I already have a pretty good idea of why your ex is your ex and it wasn't just due to the mediocre sex. (Finally, I'm a virgin so they must be another explanation for my buns of steel)

**""Don't you want to get out from underneath your auntie's feet and start living life!""**  
Yeah, I assume that you have no ulterior motives behind isolating me from the one family member I have left by having me live at your house. It's going to a hard NO from me, my auntie and I have a very good auntie-niece relationship and I'm focusing on my education and my career at the moment. Also, you're a 40 year old divorcee chatting up a 20 year old university student but you're not a creep...

**""Stop wasting your time with all this 'brainbox' stuff, women like you should be models""**  
I'm pursuing a career in Pharmacology is so I can become financially independent and don't have to rely on other people's income for my survival. I saw what being financially dependent on my father did to my mother and while I'm still semi-dependent on my auntie I'm hoping to become completely financially independent within the next 5 years.

I have plenty more but this are the top five most common comments that creeps have said to me, they might phrase it differently like the infamous ""I think gay women are just confused"" but it still boils down to the same thing. Feel free to add your own and unfortunately my friend trimmed the part of the article that had the author's name so if by some miracle she's reading this now, thank you for the idea!"

It got green-lit last year so they decided to do a closed, invite-only 'test' event this year as large crowds are still a concern. Despite this, it still garnered a bit of criticism from the local shooting community because ""women are welcome at all shooting competitions, why do they need a women-only event"". So, for the people who are still perplexed by this move I thought I would give a few reasons why we need women-only events.

**NO restrictions on what firearm we use**  
This is especially true when it comes to large caliber and milsurp rifles, women are usually banned from competing in .40 caliber plus and milsurp category. When asked the number one excuse is ""for the safety of the competitors"" because obviously women are too weak and pathetic to handle the recoil of a .450 bushmaster or Mosin-Nagant.

At this women-only event, the organizers let the competitors decide whether a firearm is too powerful for them because the competitors are fucking adults and don't the need the organizers to baby them!

(I had a lot of fun competing in the 'Milsurp-all calibers' category, came second but the woman who beat me was a class act with her Ross rifle and definitely deserved the no.1 spot on the podium)

**NO MANSPLAINING**  
It was so relaxing being able to walk around without some supposed ""expert"" telling me that my shooting technique is all wrong and I will never 'go pro' without their guidance. I kept expecting it even though it was a women-only event and your fellow competitors know that everyone has their own way of shooting that is the safest and most comfortable for them.

Also, being able to make mistakes without some man interjecting and trying to control the whole situation. We're had few injuries but we just bandaged them up and moved on, we don't need to have a two hour firearm safety lesson because someone bruised their finger on their bolt handle FFS!

**Same prizes across the board**  
They have been so many shooting competitions where the difference in what the first place winners gets is insulting. The one I will always remember was £1000 cash prize for the men's first place winner and a £100 gift card for the women's first place winner. when the winner complained, the organizers pointed out on the poster that one of the prizes is a £100 gift card and if they thought that was for second or third place then that was their fault.

Due to this being a 'test' event, the prizes are shooting accessories from the events' sponsors but we were told that from the beginning and it was made clear what winning first, second and third place would get you. (On a personal note, I'm very happy with the firearm maintenance kit I got for coming second)

Finally, it was nice for the women competitors to take centre-stage rather than be renegaded to a side show like we are in every other shooting competition I've attended. Even with a 'control group' crowd made up of the competitors' family and friends, the atmosphere was electric and you could of cut the tension with a knife when the score was really close.

P.S. I tried my best to not use too much gun lingo or firearm jargon as I know this is a very niche hobby of mine (especially in the UK). If anything is still unclear or I worded it poorly, please leave a comment and I try to clarify what I meant."

So, we all decided to get our heads shaved alongside her to support her and raise money for charity. Around that same time I met a guy we'll call 'Jake' and a spoke to him a half a dozen times and he seemed like a alright guy. I'd made it clear that I was gay so if he wanted to be more than friends he was barking up the wrong tree.

Fast forward to last week and I get a text from him out of the blue wanting to catch up, I saw no issue with this as I placed him in the 'Lawfully Neutral' category so I met him at a coffee shop for a chat. It started off fine, he was telling me about getting his bachelor's at The University of Manchester and he was going back to do his Master's. I told him about getting my foundation degree in Pharmacology and how I moving on to my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration.

He then says ""you look so beautiful with short hair, I'm so glad you got over that phase of shaving your head that all girls seem to go through these days!"".

WTF!

So, I curtly responded ""It wasn't a phase, my friends and I shaved our heads in solidarity of our good friend who had cervical cancer!"". He then dismissively says ""Well, I didn't know..."" I retorted ""I told you at the time because you ask me why had I shaved my head!"". I decided to push the issue as he had really rattled my cage at this point so I mockingly said ""Her hair grew back and she's in remission by the way, not that you give a shit!"".

We sat in silence for a moment and then he mumbled ""Well, this was a waste of time..."" It was at this point I realised that they was a rabbit away so I when full 'Tsundere' mode. Crossed legs and folded arms while glaring at him I said ""Okay, quit with the games! What's this all about, spit it out!"". This next part I will try to quote verbatim because it is every shade of creepy:

*""Well, my friend told me that he saw you in town and that you looked super hot now your hair grown back. I was bummed about getting dumped and he knew that we had something back in the day and that you were single, I also have a thing for tall girls* (for context I'm 6 foot)*. I thought we could get back together, my whole family has moved to Manchester so we could live with them until we got enough money for our own place. But, I see now that this was a complete waste of time as you're just another Feminazi!""*

...BRUH...

We spoke a half a dozen times, usually in passing and it was mostly small talk just shooting the breeze to past the time! Apparently, this fucking creep had built up this whole narrative about us having some sort of a relationship that he wanted to rekindled. unfortunately, I'd become a 'feminazi' because I stood up for myself and my friend who's battle with cancer he completely forgotten about. He also forgotten about me being gay as he was too busy writing creepy head canon about our 'relationship'.

Thankfully, my friend 'Blake' showed up at this point as I was going to wait in that coffee shop on my own originally but decided to invite 'Jake' so I could have some company. I now see that I would of been better off alone, instead I subjected myself to twenty minutes with the biggest creep on earth! My parting words were: ""You know something 'Jake', I thought you were alright but you proved me SO wrong! Sod off up to Manchester and don't come back, you absolute creep!""

He then got up and I thought it was going to kick off, 'Blake' had her deodorant ready to spray in his eyes and had my keys between my knuckles but he just storm out without uttering another word. We waited five minutes in case he was waiting to ambush us somewhere nearby but we were fine, we got the packing cases (we're moving to another city together) and when back to my place to start packing.

It just boggled my mind that he thought that I was so desperate that I was going to throw away my entire future for him, a guy I barely know who I talked to several times 2 YEARS ago. My friend 'Blake' was very impressed as she's usually the 'rough and ready hardcore feminist' of our friend's group, she even joked that I better not try and take her spot in the group.

EDIT:

Just to clarify something, this guy had NO details other than my 'nickname' and my moblie No. I've obviously blocked him now, from what I understand his family had already moved so he came down here specifically to talk to me which makes it even creepier that he had no other reason to be in town. My friend who works at the train station saw him boarding the train to Manchester so with his family in Manchester I hopefully won't have to see him when I visit my friends and family (fingers crossed)."

We moved on September 10th and have spent the last week getting settled in as both her job and my apprenticeship start tomorrow (Sept. 20th). I just realised the other day I'm feeling really good and I couldn't quite put my finger on why, even the stress of moving seem far more manageable than I expected.

I decided to tell my auntie as she is always a fountain of sagely knowledge, her response surprised me but in a good way. She says that she'd been looking for a way to talk to me about moving on without it sounding like she was booting me out (We lived together for 3 years until a week ago). She didn't say anything because she thought it was better for me to let 'life' dictate when I left, that way it would of been my decision (She also stressed that I'm ALWAYS welcome to come back if things go south).

She elaborated by saying that the problem with us living together was the fact that we are at two very different stages of our lives. She's working hard as a small business owner towards early retirement while I'm focusing on my education and career with my whole life ahead of me. However, moving into a house with someone who's similar to me (my best friend) is going to be a house with a lot more energy, motivation and drive than the house of a middle-aged woman planning her retirement.

She also added that she never worried about me running my own household, she brought up the fact that I do the majority of the chores when I lived with her while holding down a job and going to uni. She's not at all surprised that I'm feeling good because this last week has shown how capable I am, she's sure my best friend is pulling her weight (she is BTW) but she knew everything would be fine in my 'capable hands'.

Afterwards, I felt...mixed emotions because I had no idea my auntie thought that living with her was holding me back but I also surprised that she had every confidence in me to run my own household."

I said yes and she phoned to give me the details of the restaurant to go to, I was so nervous because this was the first date I've ever been on in my life. I told her and she then admitted that it was her first date ever too, this helped calm my nerves and the date when well.

Afterwards, she walked me to my car and I then offered her a lift home...I quickly walked it back a bit because I realised how creepy it is to offer someone a lift after ONE date. She politely declined as she lived near by and started to walk off, I got into my car but my gut was telling me something just wasn't right. Also, one thought came running around in my head which I couldn't shake:

*""DON'T start the engine, DON'T start the engine!""*

I realised why, as soon as I start the engine my headlights are going to dazzle her but they are also going to highlight her to...someone. My gut feeling proved to be right as my date turned on her heels and walked quickly back to my car, she asked if the lift was still on the cards (which it was) and she got in.

Come to find a group of 'unsavory' men down the road from where I parked my car and directly in the path of where my date was going to have to walk to get home. We drove past them and just their stares made my blood run cold, luckily they were no gangs of men hanging around the street she lived on. (They were in the city centre, she lived in the inter-city in a area popular with students)

She thanked me for the lift and ask if we could go on a lunch date next due to that incident, I said ""Of course, I'll just have to fit it around work"". I'm SO glad that I listened to my gut and waited a couple of minutes in order to get my date home safely because I couldn't of lived with myself if anything had happened to her due to my impatience."

Why they pick on our pharmacy in particular I have no idea as we offer the same services that every other pharmacy does but we were their target and things were going to get bad! (BTW all the staff are women) 

On Monday, they started protesting and it was unpleasant as they were spreading misinformation like 'vaccines cause cancer' and 'don't support these baby killers' which I believe was in reference to plan B. We rang the police and they told us they have every right to protest but did caution them as what they were doing could be considered a 'Breach of the peace'.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, they started harassing and trying to grab patients and in a couple of cases staff members. In one incident, one of our sales assistants when out to her car to get something on her lunch break when a protester tried to grab her in the car park near us. She ran to her car, locked the doors and our security guard had to escort her back in due to the protesters.

Again, we rang the police multiple times but every time they arrived the protesters weren't actively harassing anyone and none of the security cameras were pointed at that side of the road or the car park so they was no video evidence. Our sales assistant gave a statement but as it was 'her word against theirs' they wasn't much they could do without hard evidence.

That evening, paint stripper got thrown over someone's car and while we have no evidence that it was the protesters we can put two and two together. Now, the car in question didn't belong to any of us (I feel bad of the owner) but it looked similar to mine so we think it's a case of mistaken identity. The next day, the pharmacist made us park our cars around the back of the pharmacy to protect them.

It makes deliveries a bit difficult but it's better than getting paint stripper thrown over our cars, she then gets onto the police (again) because she wants this to end now! She gets a response because a chief inspector comes to our pharmacy...to berate the pharmacist about making false allegations and wasting police time.

The pharmacist gives him both barrels, she had enough of the excuses and wants the police to do their job. The officer who accompanied the CI said that they could have a marked car with officers in the car park where both the grabbing and paint stripper incident happened to keep an eye on the protesters. This helped curb the protesters now that they know they are being watched by a pair of officers so we thought things might be getting better...

On Friday, (my day off so this what the pharmacist told me) the protesters had set their stall up against the shutters of the pharmacy so no-one could get near. One of the pharmacist's friends lived nearby, saw this and rang the pharmacist about what they'd done so she knew what the situation was. She rang the number that the CI had given her to tell them what the protesters were doing and she informed all the staff who working that day to not come to work until she told them to.

By time she got there, all the protesters had been arrested as well as their stall being removed but unfortunately they'd superglued all the padlock keyholes shut making them impossible to open with the key. Took all morning to get them all off (local tool shop and locksmith helped with removal and replacements) so she was finally able to get open with all the staff by 1pm.

News of this must of spread because shortly after opening a Superintendent comes by with the CI from the other day looking very sheepish. The Superintendent apologized for not getting this issue sorted sooner and for his subordinate's inappropriate tirade the other day which was completely out of order.

The pharmacist told him that she wants action, not an apology so the Superintendent was able to set up a temporary exclusion zone around our pharmacy and set up regular patrols to ensure that these protesters are moved on or arrested if they try to set up within the exclusion zone. I will say that going to work on Saturday without those protesters constantly chanting was so nice but I still parked around the back just in case.

The powers-that-be can talk until they are blue in the face about 'tackling violence against women and girls' but unless the police in our local communities are willing to take the threats we face seriously then nothing going to change. Women's faith in the UK police is at an all-time-low and suffering days of harassment just to be told that WE are the ones causing the problem isn't helping at all!"

Today, a man comes in who we'll call 'Jack' for his F/CJ as our pharmacy assistant just finish sanitizing the seat for him to sit in.

I come over to do the usual pre-jab rundown and prep the F/CJ, Jack then asks ""So, when does the doc come to give me the jab?"" I inform that there is no doctor (we're a pharmacy) and I will be doing his F/CJ. Jack proclaims that it was a doctor the last time, I check his file and while he did go to a medical practice the last time it was actually a nurse who gave him the jab. (This gave me a hunch which we'll get to)

I thought Jack might be worried about me doing it due to my age (I'm only 21) so I tried to reassure him by telling him I'd done well over a hundred jabs and I'm a fully certified phlebotomist accredited by the NHS. This does nothing to calm his nerves so Jack they says ""Is they no-one else who can do it!"" I take a moment to compose myself and then say ""the only other person that do it is the pharmacist"".

He replies ""Ah, yes! Him, I want him to do it!"" and this confirmed my hunch, he assumed that some ""stupid girl"" couldn't possibly administer his F/CJ correctly and only a man could do it properly. This was further confirmed by the smug smirk he had on his face because he'd ""put the little woman in her place"" but I was going to get the last laugh.

I go to our break room where the pharmacist had finished HER lunch break and told her the situation, she starts smiling and says ""well, let's go disappoint him"". The look on Jack's face was priceless when the pharmacist he insisted on having to administer his F/CJ came out, his smug smirk replaced by a look I can only describe as a naughty school boy who'd got caught red-handed by the headmistress.

By the time Jack came up to the counter I'd already finished the paperwork so I was going to hand it off to the pharmacist and go on my lunch break but she told to wait for a minute. She gave Jack the patient copy of the paperwork as well as the usual post-jab speech but then said something at the end that I actually didn't expect.

She says ""Oh, and one more thing Jack. If you EVER disrespect my staff's ability to do their job again, you're going to have to find yourself another pharmacy and explain to your wife why. Do I make myself PERFECTLY clear!"". Jack quickly replies ""Yes ma'am!"", the pharmacist then points at me and says ""now apologise to her"".

Jack turns to me and says ""Sorry ma'am, won't happen again"" I was absolutely starving at this point so I just said ""apology accepted"". Jack then quickly leaves the pharmacy to avoid any further scolding, the pharmacist then said ""right ladies, show's over. back to work"" and let me go for my lunch break. It was so nice to know that our boss has got our backs when faced with 'difficult' patients like Jack."

The neuropsychologist I spoke to said that it's difficult to diagnose TGA (or any form of amnesia) but after several consultations and various scans that was her conclusion. When she told me about the condition so many things fell into place, the gaps in my memory, the way it would come and go with no way of knowing when it would happen.

My auntie and friends have been super supportive but as many of you already know, women's healthcare is appalling and if you have mental health issues they have the perfect excuse. I got diagnose with C-PTSD (which was a struggle too) but I still had this other issue that no doctor would take seriously. I never thought of it being a form of amnesia but I knew it was affecting my memory, one misogynistic doctor blamed my period and that women just 'naturally' have bad memories.

I've swapped doctors several times but when they weren't blaming the problem on that 'pesky' uterus of mine they kept saying it was all part of my C-PTSD. I knew they was more to it but then the pandemic hit so the whole thing got shelved, this turned out to be a good thing because the person who got it off the shelf was a neuropsychologist who actually believed that they was more to it as well.

I feel so vindicated and happy, it's not great to know I have another condition alongside my C-PTSD but at least I have a proper diagnosis rather than shrugs and excuses. I did say to her that while it may be difficult to diagnose they could of at least handed off to her in the first place rather than stone-walling when I asked for a second opinion or giving it to their friend who just agreed with them to get rid of me.

She admitted that my file only got referred to her because the doctor who had it pre-pandemic retired and his files got re-distributed, she noticed that I had a 'ongoing' concern so contacted me to chase up this 'ongoing' concern. I was worried it might be a brain tumor, the doctors sit on their hands and by the time they do find it they say ""it's stage 4 and terminal"" and I die because of their laziness and inaction.

So, TYSM to the neuropsychologist who found out what was wrong and a big ""fuck you!"" to all the doctors who wouldn't listen to me, blamed it on my period and basically said ""it's all in your head""."

Ever since I got 'outed' and my Aunt helped me run away when my parents were going to force me into GCT (Gay Conversion Therapy) I've suffered from C-PTSD and TGA (transient global amnesia). However, getting those two conditions diagnosed has been a uphill struggle because all the doctors want to talk about when they see my BMI index is my weight.

I actually had one doctor say to me ""If you're not willing to accept what the REAL issue here is then we have nothing else to discuss"" (I now know I should of got her refusal in writing). It was my therapist (who's a clinical psychologist) who informally diagnosed me with C-PTSD, this was then formally diagnosed by a neuropsychologist at a specialist clinic. TGA took a lot longer to diagnose due to COVID but I just got the diagnosis recently and it explains so much about the issues I've been having.

The 'healthy weight gain' diets the other doctors tried to forced me onto always seem very unhealthy to me and I knew that they would blame me if I went too far the other way and ended up overweight. So, I stuck to my guns and continued to eat a healthy, balanced diet and eventually I've gotten to the 'healthy weight' band of the BMI index without resorting to 'quick fix diets' like they wanted me to do.

I feel vindicated and now that I'm getting treatment for my mental health issues I can focus a lot more on my physical health, I've starting going to yoga classes again and just generally being more active. I've gotten out of the 'lockdown rut' I found myself in earlier this year, I'm the happiest and healthiest I've ever been. If the doctors had taken my concerns seriously from the start I could've gotten to this point a lot earlier and could now be 'further down the road' as it were.

Just needed to vent about this, stay safe and stay strong!

EDIT: Just to clarify, I know there's a lot of controversy surrounding the BMI index but it's still the chart a lot of doctors use unfortunately."

I mentioned that I've always wanted to cosplay as HUNK from RE2, we start talking about ideas and how to make a gas mask that is easy to put on and take off. I leave it with him and a few weeks later Alex has got the whole costume figured out and it looks amazing (including the quick-release gas mask system).

I try it on for size and it fits well, most of it is just milsurp clothing but the helmet and quick release gas mask system are custom-made. Alex has also got a selection of imitation weapons where you can move certain parts but are just for show, with all the 'guns' and 'knives' added I look like the character himself. Alex asks if he can take a few pictures for social media and as my face wouldn't be in them (obviously) I agreed and he took a bunch of pictures with me posing with the guns and knives drawn.

I pack up the costume and leave, the next day Alex sees me and says rather sheepishly ""Did you see the pictures I posted?"" I admitted that I'd been busy and hadn't got around to it but I could tell something was off. I enquired ""why?"", Alex didn't answer so I just said ""let me guess, the comment section is a cesspool of misogyny and hatred?"". Alex then replies with ""You were just wearing a costume, what the fuck is wrong with these people!"".

Alex pulls the gallery up on his phone and in the title he had used the word ""she"" and had also referred to me as 'Ms. Grim Reaper' (HUNK is nicknamed 'Mr. Grim Reaper' by Warhawk). I will admit that they was some constructive comments but the majority weren't, just a barrage of hatred and mockery. They were also some tasteless jokes about this being 'The Feminazi final form' and that 'Girls be dressing up like this to avoid getting needle spiked'. (not at all funny considering this is a major worry for women ATM)

They was also a fair amount of people calling me 'Princess Pick-me' or 'Little Miss Pick-me' because it's not like women could enjoy survival horror games. Alex was shocked and appalled but also amazed at how calm I was, I told him that ""I suspected this would happen, that's why I didn't want to show my face"". I informed him that ""A woman having fun, on the internet! We can't be having that!"" is a depressingly common occurrence.

Alex decided to take the album down and apologized to me, it's no skin of my nose but it goes to show that men have no idea the amount of harrassment and hatred women have to put up with both on the internet and IRL. (Alex and I are still cool obviously, he received hate before just not on that scale)"

I found this odd because Amy usually turns up last as she has to travel the furthest on public transport. Come to find out Amy was followed and verbally harassed while walking from one side of the transport interchange to the other in order to change buses on Friday night.

No-one intervened or gave a shit about this complete bastard harassing her, Amy was only able to get away because she rounded a corner and ducked into the women's toilets and lock herself in one of the stalls. He lost track of her after that although Amy did panic when someone did come in but it turn out to just be the cleaner. Amy did report the man who harassed her to the management office of the transport interchange and the police BUT neither could do anything about it.

Due to the person wearing a face mask identifying him was going to be extremely difficult and the police didn't have the personnel to patrol the transport interchange. This is why Amy's mum pick her up from the transport interchange and took her to work the other day, the police have proven they have NO interest in preventing crime or deterring predators like the man who was harassing Amy.

I knew when the police commissioner for the UK said: ""We'll treat violence against women and girls as seriously as Counter-Terrorism"" it was all talk and no trousers. As a result, our boss ask myself and our security guard if we wouldn't mind organizing a carpool with her to ensure everyone gets to and from work safely. I hate the fact that the responsibility of preventing crime and deterring criminals always falls on the victim while the police just wash their hands of the whole thing time and time again.

I just needed to vent and this subreddit has always been so kind and supportive so thank you so much!"

I Get an interview and everything goes WELL until I get the email confirming that I'd successfully gotten the ""job"" I applied for. Come to find out the job was for a cleaner, I checked through all my past emails and correspondence with them which all clearly stated that it was for a clinical pharmacy technician role.

Next day, I tell my boss and she tells me that's a 'bait and switch' which is against the rules regarding NHS recruitment. She helped me to file a formal complaint with the NHS and inform the union of what has happened, I deicide to get legal advice from a friend of my mine who's a lawyer who told me to collect and print out all the correspondence between myself and the NHS so she can put together a civil lawsuit if the need arises.

Meanwhile, a absolute shitstorm has kicked off behind the scenes between the union and the NHS regarding this as it's in breach of their recruitment rules and their oversight framework. So, I end up having a conference call with representatives of both the union and the NHS to discuss the situation. The NHS has fired the people involved and views that as the end of it, I inform that I will be bringing a civil lawsuit against them as I've been advised that this is a case of sex discrimination.

The union agreed with me, they believed that I had been the victim of unfair treatment and that unfair treatment could of been motivated by sex discrimination. They go on to say that the NHS had failed in upholding their own rules and need to be held accountable, they believed that I am owed some sort of compensation package due to this. However, they wished to do this via arbitration with an arbiter appointed by the union who would represent me and my best interests rather than a civil court case.

I agreed on condition that it was a 'open' arbitration meaning that I reserve the right to bring a civil lawsuit if the arbitration award isn't satisfactory and I leave it with the union. Not much happened for a while, I kept getting updates but it was mostly just informing me that it's a ongoing matter BUT it hasn't been forgotten or swept under the rug. Finally, come October 1st I get given the 'best and final' arbitration award that both the union and the NHS have agreed upon.

The award was £27.5K in compensation as well as the clinical pharmacy technician job I originally applied for. I had 7 days to respond to so I instantly sent off to my lawyer friend who told me to send her ANY legal documents they send me so she can go over them with a fine-tooth comb. She told me that this a solid offer that she would personally take, she did inform me that signing this would waive my right to sue them but this is a standard 'ass-covering' clause that all arbitration awards have.

I agreed and signed the arbitration award, took a few weeks to get the payment released and I started the job a week ago. The thing that sticks with me is the fact that I just thought it was a mistake, that they had just sent the wrong job offer to the wrong person. If my boss hadn't noticed it as a 'bait and switch' I would of been none the wiser and the bastards doing this would of gotten away scot-free.

Just needed to vent about this now that it's all over, a cautionary tale of how naïve I can be at times."

Things have been going well until last night when I was walking over to the staff car park and felt some sort of a presence over my left shoulder. At first, I shrugged it off as they are a fair amount of staff that work in the hospital grounds so it was probably just them doing their jobs.

But, I just couldn't shake this bad feeling and my C-PTSD was starting to act up so I got out my personal alarm and deodorant (because pepper spray is illegal in the UK) and pulled the panic-chord on my alarm. It first emits a warning siren and then the alarm goes off after a second or so delay, it was in this delay I heard someone running. I turned around expecting someone to be running towards me but instead I saw a 'shadow' running away, it was like part of the darkness was moving.

At this point, a medical sister and a security guard were heading over to me after hearing my alarm and coming to investigate the noise. As soon as they got near, I just broke down in tears because I'd been keeping my composure in case I needed to spray deodorant in an attacker's face and fight back. They took me back inside the hospital and sat me down so I could calm down, I tried to speak several times but nothing came out.

My mind was still trying to process what had just happened, I was also worried I wouldn't be believed and expected the usual ""Oh yeah, a shadow was going to attack you! Maybe it was the boogieman?"". Thankfully, the security guard had found the person on the CCTV cameras and by switching cameras could piece together what happened. The medical sister said for me not to watch it but I HAD to, the worst moment was when he was 50 feet from me over my left shoulder before I got out my alarm.

The police came to take a statement and get a copy of the CCTV footage of the incident, I think the sister must of said something because these two really nice WPCs turn up to take my statement. They listened to me and told me to ""just take your time"" whenever I would start stammering or tripping over my words. One bit of luck we had was the security guard located footage from a camera of the man BEFORE he put his mask on and hood up so the police could see his whole face.

They said with that footage and knowing which direction he approached the hospital from they should be able to piece together his movements leading up to the incident so they can find and question him. They gave me a number to ring if I need any support or I believe that this man might be stalking me and I need victim protection. I was terrified to go out again, the security guard said that obviously he would escort me to my car but I was worried about it happening again the next night.

At this point, the building manager has caught wind of what has happened and comes up with an idea which is the roof of the multi-storey car park is the old staff car park before they built the new one. He thinks that I should park up there for the foreseeable future and set up my ID card to act as a pass card to raise the barrier and allow me access to the rooftop car park. The multi-storey is connected to the hospital via a sky bridge and there's a dedicated lift to the roof so I wouldn't have to go outside.

They also offered me the rest of the week off but I declined because I knew sitting at home would let my mind run away with itself and I wasn't going to let that bastard scare me away from a job I love. Today, I used the rooftop car park, did my shift and got back home without incident so the building manager's idea is working for the time being. I'm so grateful that my friend Blake talk me into buying a personal alarm because I don't even want to consider what might of happened if I didn't have it."

For context, I used to get night terrors due to the childhood of abuse I suffered at the hands of my father who I escaped from 3 years ago with the help of my auntie. In the last 2 years, the night terrors became less frequent and to the point where I couldn't remember the last time I had a episode so I thought I had overcome them.

However, they have recently come back with a vengeance and I think the reason might be the news that my best friend is relocating to London to pursue her dream job hit me harder than I expected subconsciously. So, on Saturday night when I'd just moved in with my GF I had a episode of night terrors that left me drenched in sweat and struggling to breathe.

The problem was being in a unfamiliar place (we're in my GF's new flat) and still half-asleep I saw something in the darkness and I thought it was my father. At this point, I jumped out of bed and raced towards the bathroom where I started to being violently sick into the toilet. I hear footsteps coming towards the bathroom and as I'm still in full panic attack mode I thought they're my father's so I end up in the fetal position on the floor of the bathroom.

Next thing I feel is my partner rubbing my back and patting my head while saying ""It's okay, you don't have tell me...we'll talk about when you want to"". I can't remember how long I lay there on the floor crying, I just know that my GF never left my side and when I was finished she helped me up so I could recover in the living room.

It took a while for the shaking to stop, my GF also gave me the wash basin to sit with as I kept dry-heaving (I don't think I had anything else to bring up TBH). I did manage to get back to sleep that night somehow and the next morning I felt terrible but I was in a better state than I had been at 3am. At breakfast, I thanked my GF for want she did and said because I have still have trouble talking about ""it"".

I'm so grateful to have someone I can vulnerable around and the fact that she's happy to wait until I feel ready to talk about my past makes me feel so safe and loved, I love her so much and just wanted to share!"

We did Covid tests both Xmas eve and Xmas day which came back negative so we were good to go. After Christmas dinner and clean-up, my best friend and former housemate ask if I would see her in private as she wanted to talk to me.

She knew something had been wrong ever since she told me she was relocating to London in the new year for her dream job and wanted me to be brutally honest about my opinion. After a lot of tears I told her that I was worried that her leaving would cause me to 'regress' and become that anti-social 'mute' she met just after my auntie had saved me from my abusive monster of a father when I was 18.

She looked at me for a moment with that 'big sister' look she wears so well and proceeds to list all my achievements from the past 3.5 years and how far I've come. She kept saying ""YOU did that, not ME!"" and ""You've proven that you AREN'T 'useless' without your father, you're NOT that bastard's shadow! You're not that traumatized 18 year old girl I met, you are a strong, intelligent, independent woman!"".

She went on to say that during the pandemic when we only saw each other through the computer screen  I didn't fall apart then so it'll be the same when she's in London. She also noted that I have a great network of friends, colleagues, 'work-out' buddies and most importantly my GF who I'd just moved in with.

She finished up by saying she wasn't worried about me because I'm more than capable of handling myself in the real world as I'd shown that time and time again when we were housemates. After that, I felt a lot better about her relocating and I was glad I was able to get my feelings off my chest as they were eating away at me but I didn't want to 'rain on her parade' as I am genuinely happy for her.

Thank you for letting me share this, may you all have a happy new year!"
